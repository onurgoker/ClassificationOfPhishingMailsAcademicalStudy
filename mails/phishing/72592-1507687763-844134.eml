After rallying from recent lows, Bitcoin prices have been stuck in
the $4,000-$4,500 range for a couple of weeks.

What will it take for the digita l currenc y to head back
to $5,000 and beyond?

The return of buzz, which will bring buyers back to the market.
And that will take a catalyst, like the rollback of China’s ban on
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which killed Bitcoin’s buzz
in the first place.

Another catalyst could be a financial crisis which could make
Bitcoin the “safe heaven” asset, as investors flee financial assets.
Like the 2008-09 financial crisis that extended across almost
every asset category. Or a sovereign debt crisis.

Then there’s the prospect of a regional wa r, beginning either in
North Korea or the South China Sea, which would disrupt global trade;
or in the Middle East, where Saudi Arabia and Iran are moving
closer to an open wa r.

And there’s the prospect of an endorsement by a major
Wall Street institution, which would increase awa reness
among investors, helping the demand for Bitcoin cross the
“tipping point” and reach cascade.

How likely is it that any of these catalysts will materialize?
They are all likely, but it takes time.

The Chinese Communist part y Convention, for instance, will be over
at the end of this month. This means that the first catalyst may
materialize soon after. Time may get close for the second catalyst,
as financial markets undergo a crisis, every 8-10 years;
and eight years have already lapsed since the last crisis.

As of the other two catalysts, it’s hard to set a time.

That’s why investors in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should take
a longer view on placing their bets on the digita l currenc y,
always keeping in mind that Bitcoin is an alternative to
national currencies, and the “new gold,” a hedge against
global uncertainty.
