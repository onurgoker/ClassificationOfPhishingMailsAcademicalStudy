and was completely annoyed by how they like to be in a super hero universe but dance around ever saying any real super hero names. Very clearly in the DC universe with all the Wayne this and that and "laughing gas" but never a mention of any legit superheroes. Besides that nitpick, the show was just boring. Thats how they avoided paying royalties I suspect as much as well. It's just annoying as hell to hear them constantly dance around it. They could have just created their own made up super hero universe to operate in and would have made at least that much of the show a bit more enjoyable. They did make up their own superheros While still traipsing around not saying Batman and the like. I never watched past the first episode so I don't know what they ended up doing. I don't recall any mention of made up super heroes in the first ep but it has been a while since I've watched it so I could be wrong. I don't think DC actually has an organization dedicated to cleaning up after them, but I'm pretty sure a lot of the heroes like Superman and The Flash help clean up the cities if they make a mess of it. In Marvel, they have Damage Control. In DC, I think Bruce has a company that cleans upwere the other way around, but I'm still pissed even with the call being in the pat's favor. The fact that this can even happen is absurd. There are no heirs to the Brady, Manning, Brees, Rodgers QB throne. The NFL knows it's dying and is trying to milk a few more advertising dollars before the money tree wilts. I hope the HQ official does the right thing, writes an apology letter, and then repaints the wall behind him with his brains. Pats fan here. That was a TD and I'm sorry that happened. I'd prefer to win (or lose) without these sorts of calls. Just a note: that was not a bad call by
