From: Col. Wendy M. Barnett

      Hello, this is Wendy Barnett (Mrs.) a Colonel in the U.S. Army
deployed to Afghanistan.

It will interest you to know that I have appointed you as my beneficiary
to receive ($20Million USD) for investment and/or safekeeping purposes.

The money is packaged in two military boxes and it is presently at the JFK
Airport Facility in New York, United States ready for onward shipment to
your any provided address (Door-Step).

My desire and purpose is to have the U.S Military Air & Surface
Transportation Company in New York to deliver the two boxes to you or to
any overseas address under your supervision as long as I am assured that
it will be safe in your care until I return home.

PLEASE reply with your delivery address and contact information; the deal
is 60/40 split (60% for me, and 40% for you); I am not a greedy person and
I hope you will not double cross a single Mother who have sacrifices her
life in the service of our great nation;

God bless you as you extend your helping hand to the needy!

Respectfully,
    Wendy M. Barnett (Mrs.), Deputy Director,
(AMRDEC)
