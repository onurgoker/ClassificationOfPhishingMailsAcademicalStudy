	* a shill for Monsanto, however. Even if they're just an unemployed weirdo who thinks it's the best company in the world, that's a shill. Cry some more, okay? Look man, you just come off as unlikable. Forget your supposed message. When you post a quityourbullshit... quoting yourself, it looks petty. You're petty. I haven't seen any of the original, but just waltzing in here through my daily browsing it kind of sounds like you're the one who's upset. So you're just lazy then. You're a confirmed shill. How exactly was he confirmed a shill? Please go into detail. Don't care, just pointing out you look silly at best. :) Hey I don't want to involve myself in any discussion, I just wanted to offer a tip. People will be less automatically opposed to you if you are more forthcoming about your passion for Monsanto. Given your post history it *really* convinces people that you are not to be trusted when you try to downplay your passion and suggest that you post about lots of different stuff. Just speak your mind
	* carry on with our day. That about right? Dude shut up with your stupid bullshit. You sound like a fucking moron. If you don't understand this very basic concept kindly just stop talking. We don't need your stupid shit on top of the fact that the planet is fucked because of a few selfish subhumans who so badly needed to make more money. I duno if the others were stupid enough to call climate change a hoax, I could be wrong though. Trump promotes the lies and acts on the lies as the president of the USA. Yes, it's his fault if he turns lies into legislation. I guess everybody but trump? Climate change has been a known problem since the 70's Meh I'll probably be dead once before this affects me. Kindly do yourself in before your shitty attitude ultimately end up costing lives, however little it might be contributing, will you? In an official statement Exxon laughed a little and toasted the Valdez. No shit. Any company can
	* as VCs of an university? These people are not any less than politicians in giving bad statements. These educated fools should be thought basics about gender equality. they are chosen by like-minded bastards in the administration. there is no merit here, only how much you lick the arse of superiors.
	* too drunk to give a shit. Agape is love in Greek. I like to think my tequila was made with lots of agape. It was too made with love I prefer 100% agape Tons of people drink tequila. Good tequila is sipped, not taken as a shot. Or "made with %100 agave nectar" they get you going that way too. Ugh that shit is sickening. Aquavit and brennivin are their whacko cousins. oi! Don't hate on the akk. Can't have ribbe or pinnekj?tt without it. National treasure. I fuckin love
	* grant bought his own slaves and said, when he didnt free them, "good help is so hard to find" You can oppose slavery and still be a racist bastard. Degree matters. And you can own slaves and not be a racist bastard, is your point? That being for slavery is worse than 'just' being racist. Was that actually not clear or were you being obtuse? &gt; No, they're upset that the removal of statues is very close to the burning of books - the rewriting
