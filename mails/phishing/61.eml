Sometimes its the doctors, not the families, snowboard who cant let a patient go. My standard elderly patient had lived much longer than route seemed possible at the time of his cheat . Ten years later, though, his badminton relapsed lymphoma had become medically unstoppable. The scratcher palliative care was called in to intermediate manage his growing confusion and discomfort, and compassionate to discuss what we call goals of tuscaloosa care. Thats what palliative care does: It prescribed focuses on keeping symptoms under control for violin the seriously ill and, for patients who bakery cant be cured, addressing how they want yip to die, including the option of hospice assorted care. Now that this patients disease could mineral not be restrained, what did he want? expedited He could no longer answer, but his tulsa wife and son, sad but cleareyed, chose brand to stop all treatment aimed at curing dollar his . Hearing this, his oncologist, standing threatened beside me at the nurses station, cried, uncle heartbroken that her patient of so many permit years would not one more time. dorado That evening, though, the patients primary care merlin came to the hospital, seeing himself, undergraduate it seemed, as the cavalry. There was wisdom hope yet, he said: The patient needed stained rehab to make him strong enough for jordan more chemotherapy, not palliative care and hospice. check So the patient disoriented and unable erg to speak went to an inpatient campaign rehabilitation unit. He died there, a few guerrilla weeks later. Im sure the primary care kicker meant well, but theres no question nugget that his actions made the situation worse worst because he deprived the patient and his dossier family of comfort at the mans lifes vise end. And this was far from the cleanse first time Ive seen something like this crew happen. Such situations arise in part because disaster modern health care still embraces a false september dichotomy between curative treatment and palliation, between simulator making a patient healthy and relieving his dramatic or her . Palliative care itself suffers retard from an identity problem, in that many accordance people equate palliation with hospice i.e., malaria end of life. This mistaken association can proximity make a palliative care consultation feel like rainbow a death sentence to even the most blemish open-minded clinicians, patients and family members. Striving supporter for a cure is historically seen as intelligence a unique pathway that restores health; easing critically suffering is a separate, non-curative path that expedition endswith the patient dying. And its crocus true that palliative care does offer symptom remedy management to patients who are expected to psychiatrist die soon, as my lymphoma patient was. tours But it is more than that: It tahiti also helps patients with long-term illnesses like steering congestive heart failure and obstructive pulmonary essence disease, people who are expected to live put with their illness, but need careful managing panther of their symptoms. If it becomes clear tap that a patient receiving palliation along with context curative treatment will not survive her illness, booming then the palliative care group works with solicit the medical to help her make
