 how she shouldn't be feeling bad cause they are now Rich/ Famous . But yeah, it seems she cares for him &gt; money Now that, ladies and gentlemen, is true love. &lt;3 &gt; She's been with him since the very start, when he had nothing and was nothing. I love their story. Ha-ha. He supported him while he would play video games, and do nothing. It's crazy how tolerant she was of him. True love, I guess. Through thick, and thin. Even when they had no money Connor was training as hard as he does now. You don't just become a champion without working for it What's their story please Connor was a plumber, broke as hell. They were dating and he told her he wanted to presume MMA. He quit his job and moved in to her apartment. She would support him and cook healthy meals for him, even though it cost her because he wasn't working at the time, just training. They came from nothing in Ireland to now Connor is an MMA champion and they are multi-multi millionaires. Pursue,

afford to pay back their debt any higher Just reading this hurts Guess Russia is doing wonderfully since their central bank has higher rates than the EU, us , Japan, canada, etc. Just 10/10 What do you think the purpose of low interest rates are? It's to offset the effects of a sluggish economy by encouraging spending; and yes it's also so that debt does not accrue as rapidly. How are you disagreeing with any of this? It's not controversial or anything it's literally just basic facts. It's to prevent deflation forcing the banks to pump money into the economy. It has nothing to do with "collapsing institutions" nor can it be used as a magic proof of such. Your argument is asinine. If low interest rates were proof of being on the brink of collapse this would be the case for the entire developed world . There are many other factors that come into play with these strategies and none of it is "basic". The fact you'd think so speaks volumes. They are collapsing. It's a ticking time bomb that will crash the European economy. Lol stop reading conservative propaganda The world isn't ready for this kind of globalization,
