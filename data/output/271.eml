The Breakthrough Discovery That Lowers Blood Pressure Naturally




and was completely annoyed by how they like to be in a super hero universe but dance around ever saying any real super hero names. Very clearly in the DC universe with all the Wayne this and that and "laughing gas" but never a mention of any legit superheroes. Besides that nitpick, the show was just boring.

I'd prefer to win (or lose) without these sorts of calls. Just a note: that was not a bad call by
