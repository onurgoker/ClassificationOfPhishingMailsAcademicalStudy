FROM MONEYGRAM WESTERN UNION OFFICE FBI!!!
Dear Beneficiary,

After proper and several investigations and research at Western Union and
Money Gram Office, we found your name in Western Union database among
those that have sent money through Western Union and this proves that you
have truly been swindled by those unscrupulous persons by sending money to
them through Western Union/Money Gram in the course of getting one fund or
the other that is not real.

In this regard a meeting was held between the Board of Directors of
WESTERN UNION, MONEYGRAM, the FBI alongside with the Ministry of Finance,
As a consequence of our investigations it was agreed that the sum of Two
Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars (U.S.250,000.00) should
be transferred to you out from the funds that The United States Department
of the Treasury has set aside as compensation payment for scam victims.

This case would be handled and supervised by the FBI. We have submitted
your details to them so that your funds can be transferred to you. Contact
the Western Union agent office through the information below:
