Do something newNew hobbies, experiences, and information help stimulate the brain. Doing different things that are out of the usual routine changes the structure of the brain and creates neural pathways that increase the intellect of an individual.2. Do aerobic exercises regularlyPhysical exercise, especially aerobic exercises, can do wonders for the behavioral and molecular brain functions. Even after just 20 minutes of physical activity, the brain will have improved memory functions and the information processing will be facilitated. Exercise also stimulates neuroplasticity, which leads to the creation of new connections between brain cells.3. Regular memory trainingWhen being forgetful becomes a problem, training the brain to remember is a must. Train the brain to memorize telephone numbers, passport identification numbers, credit card, insurance, and even driving license numbers. This will boost memory functions if done on a daily basis.4. Be curiousCuriosity can be a good thing if done to gain knowledge and important information. Ask questions about things or objects that are hard to understand. By being inquisitive, the brain is forced to innovate and become creative in forming new ideas. Curiosity now becomes a pathway for new information and learning new things.5. Think positiveOverthinking things can aggravate the mind and body. It can also cause unnecessary stress and anxiety that can burden the brain. They can extinguish brain neurons and even stop the production of new ones. Being optimistic speeds up the creation of new and healthy brain cells. So steer clear of pessimists and negative thoughts and focus on the positive side of life.6. Eat healthyEating a healthy and well-balanced meal will greatly affect your brain power. The brain consumes about 20 percent of the nutrients and oxygen that are derived from food. So, feed the brain with healthy food like fruits, vegetables, proteins, and carbohydrates to fuel it and facilitate its functions.7. Do not smokeTo improve brain functions and use more of your brain, you have to quit smoking immediately. It does not only hinder your brain functions but also puts you at risk for numerous chronic diseases that can be avoided if you quit smoking.8. Read a bookReading is an activity which can give you the opportunity to escape into a different world. It is also a great way to train your brain as it forces it to visualize images or situations from the book. It triggers imagination and creativity, which are important factors for boosting the power of your brain.9. Get enough rest and sleepRest and sleep relax the brain and help it generate new cells. It is also effective in eliminating toxins that build up in your body during the day. It is also important to take naps every day to rejuvenate your brain.10. Challenge the mindChallenge the mind with some brain games, mental exercises, and new activities every day. This helps you use more of your brain and train yourself to think clearly, quickly and creatively. Moreover, those whose brains are constantly exercised have fewer chances of having dementia in the future.
