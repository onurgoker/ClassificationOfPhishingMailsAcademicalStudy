Topic:- How Home Healthcare is Changing the Medical Device Game
 Now! : 

Topic Overview:This medical device training program will provide an understanding of creative methodologies to solve design and development challenges of connected solutions for patient monitoring, scheduling, tracking, or drug delivery. It will demonstrate how consumer technologies vary by level of complexity and how they can be used in healthcare.

Why should you attend this 
webinar?Medical devices will look and feel different in the next 20 years because our design criteria are changing. Home healthcare and the demands of remote patient monitoring add a new level of complexity. Design and usability research for home-based medical devices will elicit vastly different design inputs, because the user profiles are drastically different than they are at the hospital. The technology requirements will continue to increase with real concerns regarding how personal data will be protected, along with potential interference of device functionality by hackers, which may directly affect efficacy.
This session will explain how consumer vital tracking and clinical grade devices are converging. It will also discuss the issues developing these devices and how they've been solved in past development programs.

Areas Covered in the 
Session:

* How consumer vital tracking and clinical grade devices are converging;
* The issues developing these devices and how they've been solved in past development programs;
* The four types of connectivity solutions by level of complexity; and

* How to decide which device type and development route is best for your application.

Speaker's Credentials:Tom has been a product innovator for over 26 years, and holds a Certificate in Master of Product Development at Northwestern University and a bachelor's degree in Industrial Design at MCAD.
