We meeting Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub April 27th discuss asset management. In preparation meeting would like gain understanding nature business relationship SW. Could you, general terms, describe sales activities SW. What typical quantities term sales? Are services provide? How much pipeline capacity buy sell them? Who main contacts SW Gas? We propose provide full requirements supply SW involving control assets. For attractive SW, probably take regulatory risk gas purchase disallowance commissions. This difficult clear mandate commissions acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) look like. Offering guaranteed discount 1st month index may attractive unless accept regulatory risk. That risk may acceptable desk. I investigation PGA's see opportunity. As asset management: preference structure? Are elements would like see? Any ideas would greatly appreciated. Thanks, Laird
