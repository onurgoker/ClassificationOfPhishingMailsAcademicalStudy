Crocker" <clclegal2@aol.com> Subject: Investment Structure STRUCTURE: Typically structure limited partnership corporate (or LLC) general partner. The General Partner owns 1% project carries liability construction. LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would purchased name limited partnership land loans, land improvements loans construction loans would name limited partnership. Each individual investors principals Creekside would also personally guarantee loans. If investor(s) sign loans, generally means larger amount cash required investor's share profits reduced. All loans residential construction, intended re-sale, full recourse loans. If pursuing multifamily rental developments, construction loans still full recourse mortgage often non-recourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment used land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees organization condominium association formation, appraisals. Unlike many real estate investment programs, none funds used fees Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses incurred estimated 6 month design approval period. EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed cash flow part land cost represent extension fees due seller 4 months extensions closing. As alternative, close land loan probably 70% appraised value. With land value equal purchase price $680,000 would mean land loan $476,000 estimated monthly interest payments $3,966, given 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% loan amount closing costs loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once site plan approved City Austin, City require development entity post funds fiscal improvements, referred "fiscals". This cost represents bond completion improvements COA considers vital funds released improvements completed accepted COA. This release 90% cost remaining 10% released one year completion. Releases granted every 90 days expect release would occur 6 months start lot improvement construction. These fiscals usually posted cash irrevocable letter credit. As such, counted development cost, even though spent. Because spent interest charged funds. The lot improvement loan typically 75% appraised value finished lot, I suspect least $20,000 potentially high $25,000. This would produce loan amount $15,000 $20,000 per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs $9,000, 'fiscals' $2,000 land cost $8,000 , total improved lot cost $19,000 means $0 $4,000 per lot total equity. The investment prior obtaining improvement loan would count towards equity requirement provided direct costs. Thus, additional equity improvement loan would $0-$184,000. Even maximum loan would cover costs, unlikely bank would allow reimbursement funds spent. The higher estimates equity investments shown preliminary proforma safe side. The engineer preparing tentative site layout initial evaluation phasing, significantly reduce cash equity requirement. Phasing works follows. If first phase say 40 units, total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. Of this, probably $13,000 would improvements $19,000 land cost. The improvements higher cover large one time front costs design costs, entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing landscaping, on, well 100% land. The land loan undeveloped lots would 70% appraised raw lot value, I would estimate $10,000 per lot loan value $7,000 per lot. Then loan value improved lot would $15,000 per lot. This would give total loan $992,000, total cost $1,232,645 equity required $241,000. This presented initial analysis phasing depended careful assessment Civil Engineer separate phases must able stand utility standpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANS There three types construction loans. First, speculative (spec) loan taken prior pre-sales activity. Second, construction loan pre-sold unit, loan remains builder/developers name. Third, pre-sold unit construction loan name buyer. We expect 8 spec loans start project expect loans pre-sold units loans name builder/developer. We expect construction loans name buyers, loans difficult manage please new buyers unfamiliar process. Spec loans 70% 75% value construction loans pre-sold units, construction loan mortgage lender, 80% 95% value. DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements handled General Partner cover current near term third party costs, necessary reserves, priority payments partners per agreement. The General Partner contract Creekside Builders, LLC construct units fee CB include construction management overhead fee equal 15% direct hard cost excluding land, financing sales costs. These fees monies Creekside, Larry Lewter prior calculation profit, except a) direct reimbursement partnership expenses b) direct payment CB subcontractor costs perform. For example, CB cannot find good trim carpenter sub, cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., decides undertake function, charge partnership fee able obtain third parties disclose cases partnership. Finally, CB receive fee use equipment used lieu leasing equipment others. At present CB significant equipment, considering purchase sky track facilitate speed framing, cornice, roofing drywall spreading. REPORTING We willing provide reports track expenses vs. plan.
