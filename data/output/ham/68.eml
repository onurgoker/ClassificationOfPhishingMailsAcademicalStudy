San Juan Index ---------------------- Forwarded Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT 09/28/2000 01:09 PM --------------------------- From: Phillip K Allen 09/28/2000 10:56 AM Liane, As discussed yesterday, I concerned may attempt manipulate El Paso San Juan monthly index. It appears single buyer entered marketplace September 26 27 paid market prices ($4.70-$4.80) San Juan gas. At time trades, offers physical gas significantly (10 15 cents) lower prices bypassed order establish higher trades report index calculation. Additionally, trades line associated financial swaps San Juan. We compiled list financial physical trades executed September 25 September 27. These complete list trades Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, Prebon). Please see attached spreadsheet trade trade list summary. We also included summary gas daily prices illustrate value San Juan based several spread relationships. The two key points data follows: 1. The high physical prices 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) much greater high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) days. 2. The spread relationship San Juan points (Socal & Northwest) consistent end September October gas daily. It make sense monthly indices dramatically different. I understand review trades submitted outliers. Hopefully, trades submitted reveal counterparty names able determine one buyer 4.70's trades outliers. I wanted give additional points reference aid establishing reasonable index. It Enron's belief trades $4.70 higher market trades excluded calculation index. It desire reliable accurate indices conduct physical financial business. Please contact anytime I assist towards goal. Sincerely, Phillip Allen
