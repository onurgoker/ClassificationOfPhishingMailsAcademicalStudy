Thoughts Presentation ---------------------- Forwarded Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT 06/12/2000 10:55 AM --------------------------- From: Tim Belden 06/11/2000 07:26 PM To: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Thoughts Presentation It shame CAISO provide actual generation unit. The WSCC data, dicey July 1999, CEMMS, comes delay, ultimately best sources. For purposes CAISO may suffice. I think probably know already, siginificant difference "scheduled" "actual" generation. You pulling "scheduled." If someone schedule generation generates, either instructed uninstructed, miss that. You may also miss generation northern california munis smud schedule net load caiso. That is, 1500 MW load 1200 MW generation, may simply schedule 300 MW load sc transfers imports 300 MW. Having said that, probably close enough better alternatives generation side. On load side I think I would simply use CAISO actual load. While split NP15 SP15, I think using actual number better "scheduled" number. The utilities play lots game load side, usually under-scheduling depending price. I think presentation looks good. It would useful share others finished. I'd like see much gas demand goes additional GW gas-generated electricity, especially compared gas consumption. I surprised small UEG consumption compared uses. If largest marginal consumer obviously different story. Let's talk.
