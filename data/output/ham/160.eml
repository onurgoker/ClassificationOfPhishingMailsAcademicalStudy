Price Stanfield Term ---------------------- Forwarded Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT 07/26/2000 10:44 AM --------------------------- Michael Etringer 07/26/2000 08:32 AM To: Keith Holst/HOU/ECT@ect, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Price Stanfield Term I sending follow-up bid I submitted Clark County PUD. They requested term pricing Stanfield volume 17,000. Could give basis period : Sept -00 - May 31, 2006 Sept-00 - May 31, 2008 Since I assume keep Stanfield basis, rather basis Malin Rockies, would probably make sense show basis adjustment one point. Also, Mid - Offer Spread terms. Thanks, Mike
