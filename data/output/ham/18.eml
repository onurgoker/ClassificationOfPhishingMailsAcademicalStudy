Note construction management fee (CMF) stated 12.5% rather standard rate 10%. This increase cost loan cost ratio 75%, increase loan amount reduce required cash equity. Also, quite confident direct unit lot improvement costs high. Therefore, additional room actual bids, The Met project next door reported cost $49 psf without overhead CMF, $54-55 CMF. It appears cash equity $1,784,876. However, I fairly sure get project done $1.5MM. I hope finish proforma today. The rental rates project $1250 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 2 bedroom $1425 3 bedroom. Additional revenues could generated building detached garages, would rent $50-75 per month. - winmail.dat
