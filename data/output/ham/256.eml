Re: $100 yard seems like enough 12.5 hours. How long take him? I think $100 enough. Use Page Setup File menu change Portrait Landscape want change printing vertically printing horizontally. Also try selecting Fit one page want print one page. Use Print preview see print look like print. The truck might need new sparkplugs around 120,000-125,000 miles. A valve adjustment might good. It idled high last 25,000 miles, never broken down. Glad hear good deposit week. Great job February. Phillip
