Transport p&l ---------------------- Forwarded Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT 05/30/2000 01:32 PM --------------------------- From: Colleen Sullivan 05/30/2000 09:18 AM To: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Transport p&l Phillip-- I've noticed one thing intra-month transport p&l looks strange me. Remember I know Northwest all, may issue, I'll point let decide. Let know O.K. is, I'll know ignore future. Also, want get Kim Sitara people change mapping, let know I'll take care it.. On PG&E NW, appears PGEN Kingsgate mapped Malin Citygate curve instead Kingsgate curve, resulting total transport loss $235,019. (If mapping changed, reallocate p&l--not change overall p&l.) Maybe reason mapping maybe affects something else somewhere I seeing, anyway, Deal #'s, paths p&l impacts each. 139195 From Kingsgate Malin ($182,030) 139196 From Kingsgate PGEN/Tuscarora ($ 4,024) 139197 From Kingsgate PGEN Malin ($ 8,271) 231321 From Kingsgate Malin ($ 38,705) 153771 From Kingsgate Stanfield ($ 1,988) Suggested fix: Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping GDP-Malin Citygate GDP-Kingsgate. Clay Basin storage--this really FYI anything else--I see five different tickets Sitara Clay Basin activity--one appears withdrawals four injections. Clay Basin valued Questar curve, substantially NWPL points. What means time injecting gas, tickets show transport losses; time withdrawing, show big gains transport. I'm sure best way handle since really systematic Sitara way handling storage deals. In ideal world, seems would map way today, injection times, transport cost would pass storage costs. Anyway, here's detail tickets info, plus I noticed three days appears withdrawing injecting Clay Basin. There may operational reason occurred I'm aware of, dollar impact small, I thought I'd bring attention case there's something want it. The columns show volumes ticket p&L associated each.
